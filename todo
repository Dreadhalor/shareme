- when loading the user, there's a brief delay between setting the user & the user actually being set EVEN THOUGH I use the arrow syntax for setState
- maybe don't have the mobile menu take up 4/5 of the screen & instead just have a minimum width
- long names should be truncated when displayed underneath their pins
- probably use a library to parse domain names accurately & account for all edge cases
