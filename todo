- when loading the user, there's a brief delay between setting the user & the user actually being set EVEN THOUGH I use the arrow syntax for setState
- long names should be truncated when displayed underneath their pins
- probably use a library to parse domain names accurately & account for all edge cases
- there's a slight alignment issue with the CreatePin upload section when switching from lg to md on Chrome, not really very noticeable
